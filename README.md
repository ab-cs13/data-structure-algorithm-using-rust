# data-structure-algorithm-using-rust
To learn a language: implement data structures. Therefore, to understand the concepts of lifetime, borrow  and ownership of Rust, I am writing basic data structure. 
* Note : This is not a rust tutorial
## Path
We will start with concepts pointers in C to understand references of Rust. Then we will visit to other fundamental concepts.

## Rust References
Here I try my best to come up with missing pieces of programming fundamentals unknown to programmer (java programmers :) ) In java like programming language we rarely care about memory management. 

### Fundamentals Of Memory Allocation
* Stack and Heap :  



## Implemented data structures:
I am going to implement following data structures and algorithms. I won't be explaining those. Code has explanations why it is done that way. I have kept the explanation as simple as possible. Linked list based data structure is a good starting point.

> Linked lists were a great innovation for simple computer architectures similar to the 1970-era PDP-11, but they defeat most of the hardware acceleration features of modern architectures with their parallel and pipelined execution resources. Multi-level memory caches, single- and multi-issue instruction pipelines, look-aside address translation and branch prediction caches, parallel arithmetic and logical execution units, etc. all end up stalling or being massively under-utilized when chasing linked lists. Think about false sharing while using linked list

* Follow the below sequence
* Stack : Linked list based stack my_stack/my_first_stack.rs
