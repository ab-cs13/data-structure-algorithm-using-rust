# hello-rust
To learn a language; implement data structures. Rust is no exception. But, we need think in Rust way (probably the best way) to implement data structures. First of all we have to understand the concepts of lifetime, borrow  and ownership of Rust. 
* Note : This is not a rust tutorial. Rather it is a repository of data structures / algorithms implemented in Rust to understand Rust 

> Hey, Rust's docs is incredibly awesome. https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/

## Implemented data structures to understand Rust fundamentals:
I am going to implement following data structures to understand fundamental concepts of Rust. I won't be explaining those here. Code has explanations why it is done that way. I have kept the explanation as simple as possible. Linked list based data structure is a good starting point.

## TODO
 * Destructor (TODO)
## Table of content (Follow the below sequence) 

* Reference-And-Lifetime 
* Stack : Linked list based stack my_stack
* my_persistent_stack
* my_linked_list i) doubly linked list ii) single linked list with mutable iterator

## Other implemented data structures   
* binary tree
* binary tree traversals DFS(in-order, pre-order, post-order) and BFS 
* balanced binary search tree 
* Queues
* Max Heap and Min Heap
* Sorting
* Graph and Graph traversals
* Minimal Spanning Trees
