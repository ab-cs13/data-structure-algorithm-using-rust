# data-structure-algorithm-using-rust
To learn a language: implement data structures. Therefore, to understand the cocepts of lifetime, borrow  and ownership of Rust, I am writing basic data structure. 

## Path
We will start with concepts pointrs in C to understand references of Rust. Then we will visit to other fundamental concepts.


## Implemented data structures:
I am going to implement following data structures and algorithms. I won't be explaining these data structure. Implementation of these data structure have explanations why it is done that way. I have kept the explanation as simple as possible. I am going to implement linked list based data structures to have an indpeth underatding of Rust liftime and ownership rules. 

> Linked lists were a great innovation for simple computer architectures similar to the 1970-era PDP-11, but they defeat most of the hardware acceleration features of modern architectures with their parallel and pipelined execution resources. Multi-level memory caches, single- and multi-issue instruction pipelines, look-aside address translation and branch prediction caches, parallel arithmetic and logical execution units, etc. all end up stalling or being massively under-utilized when chasing linked lists. Think about false sharing while using linkedlist
