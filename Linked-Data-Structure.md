## Linked Data Structure
> Linked lists were a great innovation for simple computer architectures similar to the 1970-era PDP-11, but they defeat most of the hardware acceleration features of modern architectures with their parallel and pipelined execution resources. Multi-level memory caches, single- and multi-issue instruction pipelines, look-aside address translation and branch prediction caches, parallel arithmetic and logical execution units, etc. all end up stalling or being massively under-utilized when chasing linked lists. Think about false sharing while using linked list
